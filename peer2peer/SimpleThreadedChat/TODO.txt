* CFileInfo is a node in a hierarchy of files of a local file system. 

* CNetFileHdr class takes a pointer to CFileInfo.
  It calculates and saves the number of packet to be sent.
  It saves the local path as well .
  It can tell whether this is a file or a directory
  It can tell the total size of the file.
  It can ask the CNetPacket of its size.

* Okay now I have an OS file tree built and I can generate
  a net header class (CNetFileHdr) for a file/directory represented by CFileInfo.

? What do I do with a recursive copy? What if a directory is selected for copy?

* There has got to be a send/receive controller then. It will have a pointer
  to a root node (CFileInfo) and will send/receieve all subfiles/subdirectories
  from there. Let's call it CSendReceiveController. CSendReceiveController will have
    - AttachProviderStream();
    - AttachConsumerStream();

  Sending	: Set a pointer to a root CFileInfo in CSendReceiveController.
              CSendReceiveController will iterate through all subitems of CFileInfo.
			  For each CFileInfo create a CNetFileHdr and pass a pointer to CFileInfo into it.
			  Create a CNetFile and pass a pointer to CNetFileHdr into it.
			  Call CNetFile::SendReceive(CSendReceiveController::GetProviderStream(), CSendReceiveController::GetConsumerStream()), which
			  will receive a CNetPacket at a time from ProviderStream and send this packet to the Consumer stream
  Receiving : 

CNetFile class take CNetFileInfo with local/remote file info
CNetFile attaches to ProviderStream()
CNetFile attaches to ConsumerStream()
CNetFile
NetStream >> NetFileInfo
